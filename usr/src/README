Welcome to the mercurial source repository for the Caiman Project:
GUI Install, Text Install, Distribution Constructor and Auto Installer.
This source also includes the libraries needed for the Caiman Project.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To setup a machine for building this source repository:
-------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The following steps require the user to have sufficient privileges,
via pfexec or sudo, to install software on the build system.
 1. Get the SunStudio compilers via the Image Packaging System (IPS). To install
    run the command "pkg install developer/sunstudio12u1"
	* Alternatively, the package "pkg:/developer/solaris-studio-express" may
	  be used. However, Solaris Studio 12 update 1 is the currently
	  supported build environment.

 2. Get the OS/Net Build Tools via the Image Packaging System (IPS). To install
    run the command "pkg install developer/build/onbld"

 3. Install required IPS packages:

	developer/swig
	system/boot/wanboot/internal
	system/library/install/libinstzones
	system/library/libdiskmgt/header-libdiskmgt
	system/zones/internal
	text/gnu-gettext

    To get these packages, run "pkg install <package>"

To setup the repository to be built:
------------------------------------
 1. cd usr/src in the repository

 2. cp tools/env/developer.sh .; chmod +w developer.sh

    Some environment variables which might need to be changed:
    *You should - set the path to your repository defined by CODEMGR_WS.
    *You may - need to change the SPRO_ROOT variable to point to your
     installed compilers. Likely locations are:
	 /opt/sunstudio12.1	(default)
	 /opt/solstudioex
	 /opt/SUNWspro

To build this repository use the following steps:
-------------------------------------------------
 1. cd usr/src in the repository

 2. To build, run: /opt/onbld/bin/nightly developer.sh
    This updates the source from the Mercurial repository.
 
    If you do not wish to do a Mercurial pull as part of the nightly run,
    use the -n option.

    /opt/onbld/bin/nightly -n developer.sh
