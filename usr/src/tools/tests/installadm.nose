# The single line below tells nose where to pick up installadm tests from. 
# It should be a comma-separated list of directories. To add a set of tests 
# to the installadm suite, simply add an entry to the end of the list. 
# Stand-alone test files should be in a "test" sub-directory of the 
# related code, and the files in that directory should begine with "test_". 
# Files containing in-line doc-tests should be added explicitly.
