# Description:
#	This script checks for basic network setup necessary for an AI server
#	to function.  Specifically it does the following:
#
#	- Check that svc:/network/physical:default service is set up properly:
#         * if disabled: ERROR: no net svcs
#         * if netcfg/active_ncp == "DefaultFixed": OK
#         * if netcfg/active_ncp != "DefaultFixed": WARNING(allowed).  This
#           is the case where Automatic or User NCP is configured.
#
#	- Warn if the svc:/network/dns/multicast:default is not online
#
# If anything is found to be incorrect, the script displays a message and
# returns 1.
# If all is found to be OK, the script returns 0 silently.
