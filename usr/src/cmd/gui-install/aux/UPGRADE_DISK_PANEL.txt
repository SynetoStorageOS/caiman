Disk

This panel displays the internal disks, external disks, and solid-state drives that are available on the system. This panel also displays the size of each disk in gigabytes. This panel enables you to choose a disk for the upgrade. 

Note: In order to be recognized by the installer, the disks and solid-state drives must be turned on at the time the computer boots. 

Definition

	An upgrade of the Solaris OS merges the new version of the Solaris OS with the existing files on the system's disk or disks. An upgrade saves as many modifications as possible that you have made to the previous version of the Solaris OS.


Guidelines

	* For details about a disk, move the cursor over the disk icon. A popup box provides disk specifications.

	* Solaris OS releases that are too old for upgrade are noted as such and cannot be selected.

	* Developer tools are not upgraded. You can manually upgrade these tools after the installation.
