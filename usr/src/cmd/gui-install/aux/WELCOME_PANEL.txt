Welcome to the Oracle Solaris Installer


This screen enables you to initiate an interactive installation of the Oracle Solaris Operating System (OS).

CAUTION: This installation overwrites the whole disk if one of the following is true.
		a) You are installing to the whole disk.
		b) The disk was not previously partitioned.
However, if you choose to install to a Solaris partition on the disk, the installation can be set to overwrite only that partition. Other existing partitions need not be changed. 

To view the online help for any screen in this installer, select the Help, "?", button on that installer panel.

CAUTION: This installation does not upgrade an existing Oracle Solaris OS. Instead, this installation of the Oracle Solaris OS overwrites an existing Oracle Solaris OS with the new version of the Oracle Solaris OS. If you want to upgrade an existing Oracle Solaris OS, use the pkg(1) command or the Package Manager application instead of this installer.

Note: You can choose to end the installation on any panel by selecting the Quit button.
