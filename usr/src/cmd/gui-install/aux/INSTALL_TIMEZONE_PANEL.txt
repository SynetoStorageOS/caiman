Time Zone, Date and Time


This panel enables you to enter the correct time zone, date, and time for the system to be installed. Select a time zone or location where the computer is typically used.

The top half of the panel displays a world map with major cities marked. The bottom half of the panel provides dropdown selections. You can choose the time zone either from the map or from the dropdown list. If you select a time zone from the map, your selection automatically is entered in the dropdown list. 

Procedure

OPTION 1: Select the time zone from the map. You can either click on a city or click anywhere on the map. 

	If you click on the map, but not on a city, the map automatically magnifies that area. You can click on a location within that magnified area. You can drag the cursor to move the magnified area to a different location on the map. You can right-click to deselect magnification.

	When you select a site on the map, the dropdown selections are automatically updated with the time zone, date, and current time for that map selection. 

OPTION 2: Instead of using the map, you can make your selections in the dropdown fields. 

	1. Select your region, then select Location. Finally, select time zone. The options for each dropdown are determined by the selection made in the prior dropdown.

	2. Optional: You can edit the default date and time that is provided.
