This directory contains some XSLT files for converting old-schema AI manifests
to the newer formats.

For Solaris 11 Express there was an update to the schema, which s handled by
the old-to-new.xslt.

Since Solaris 11 Express there has been another update to the XML format to
handle multi-pool and multi-disk, and some other bugs found. This is handled
by the new-to-newer.xslt.

Two Python wrapper scripts are provided for executing the transformation via
the xsltproc program.

These files are expected to be of use to QE teams and users who have a number
of custom AI Manifests that adhere to the AI Manifest schema in effect prior
to build 147 (for Solaris 11 Express) or build 167 (for Solaris 11) and who
wish to transform these manifests for use by AI in builds 167 and later.

To migrate from pre-build 147, there is a two step process using old-to-new.py
and then using new-to-newer.py on the converted files.

These files are not currently delivered as part of any package.
