USERS

In this screen, you can type a root password and define a user account for your installed system.

Note: When a user account is added, the home directory is created on the <root_pool>/export/home/<login> ZFS dataset. The parent of that dataset, <root_pool>/export/home, must exist in order for you to be allowed to create the user account.

GUIDELINE

     * Both the root password and user account are optional. But, completing all fields in the screen is recommended.

     * A user account requires only a user name in order for the account to be valid.   
    
     * The user name field has the following restrictions:
          
          * The user name cannot be root.
          * The user name must start with a letter.
          * The user name must contain characters from set [a-zA-Z0-9_.-].

     * If you type an invalid entry, an error message is displayed for that field.
