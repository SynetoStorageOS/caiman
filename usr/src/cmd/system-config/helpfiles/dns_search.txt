DNS SEARCH LIST

Specifies the additional DNS domains.  These domains will be used by the system when searching for addresses from a DNS server.

GUIDELINES

Search domains are optional.  If no domains are specified, the default search domain - composed of the domain for this system - will be used.

A maximum of six search domains can be specified.

PROCEDURE

Enter domain names starting from the top entry field.

If a DNS search list is currently used by the system, the domains will be entered into the fields as defaults.  These defaults can be changed.

NAVIGATION

Use the function keys listed at the bottom of each screen to navigate between screens. Use the arrow keys to navigate between fields.
     
Note: If the keyboard does not have function keys, or the keys do not respond, press ESC to view the alternate ESC keys for navigation.
