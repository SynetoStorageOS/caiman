DNS SERVER ADDRESSES

Specifies the IP addresses of the DNS servers that will be used by the system.

GUIDELINES

Between one and three name servers may be specified.  These name servers will be used by DNS to resolve the names of other systems.

To determine the addresses of the DNS servers, check with the system administrator.

PROCEDURE

Enter IP addresses in numeric format (e.g., 198.0.0.1).

If DNS servers are currently used by the system, their IP addresses will be entered into the fields as defaults.  These defaults can be changed.

NAVIGATION

Use the function keys listed at the bottom of each screen to navigate between screens. Use the arrow keys to navigate between fields.
     
Note: If the keyboard does not have function keys, or the keys do not respond, press ESC to view the alternate ESC keys for navigation.
