DOMAIN NAME

Identifies the system as part of a name service domain for NIS or LDAP name servers.

GUIDELINES

To determine the domain name, ask the system administrator.  Or, use the domainname(1M) command on a previously-installed system.

Typically, the domain name is a series of two to four short names separated by periods.

PROCEDURE

Enter the domain name in the edit field.

NAVIGATION

Use the function keys listed at the bottom of each screen to navigate between screens. Use the arrow keys to navigate between fields.
     
Note: If the keyboard does not have function keys, or the keys do not respond, press ESC to view the alternate ESC keys for navigation.
