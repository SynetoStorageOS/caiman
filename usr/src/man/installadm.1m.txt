DESCRIPTION

    The automated installer (AI) is used to automate the
     installation of the Oracle Solaris OS on one or more
     SPARC and x86 systems over a network.

     The machine topography necessary to employ AI over the
     network is to have an install server, a DHCP server
     (this can be the same system as the install server),
     and the installation clients.  On the install server,
     installation services are set up to contain an AI
     boot image, which is provided to the clients in order
     for them to boot over the network, AI manifests, one
     of which will be selected for the client, and SMF
     configuration profiles, zero or more of which will be
     selected for the client.

     The AI boot image content is available as an AI ISO
     image which is unpacked by the create-service subcommand
     into the installation service's image area. 

     Installation services are created with a default AI
     manifest, but customized manifests can be added to an
     installation service by using the add-manifest
     subcommand.  The add-manifest subcommand also allows
     criteria to be specified, which are used to determine
     which manifest should be selected for an installation
     client.  Criteria already associated with a manifest
     can be modified using the set-criteria subcommand.

     Manifests can include information such as a target device,
     partition information, a list of packages, and other
     parameters (see ai_manifest(4)).  When the client boots,
     a search is initiated for a manifest that matches the
     client's machine criteria. When a matching manifest is
     found, the client is installed with the Oracle Solaris
     release according to the specifications in the manifest
     file.

     System configuration profiles are complementary to
     manifests in that they also contain specifications for an 
     installation. In particular, profiles are used to specify 
     configuration information such as user name, user password,
     timezone, hostname, and ip address.  System configuration
     profiles are processed by smf(5) and conform to document
     format service_bundle(4).

     If you want a specific client to use a specific installation
     service, you can associate that client with the service by
     using the installadm create-client subcommand. You can also
     use create-client to modify an existing client.

     The installadm utility can be used to accomplish the 
     following tasks:
     - Set up installation services and aliases
     - Set up installation images
     - Set up or delete clients
     - Add or delete manifests
     - Specify or modify criteria for a manifest
     - Add or delete system configuration profiles
     - Validate profiles
     - Add or modify criteria for a manifest or profile
     - Export profiles
     - Enable or disable installation services
     - List installation services
     - List clients for an installation service
     - List manifests for an installation service
     - List profiles for an installation service


SUBCOMMANDS AND OPTIONS
     The installadm command has the subcommands and options 
     listed below. Also, see EXAMPLES below.

    
     installadm

          Displays command usage.

    
     installadm create-service
         [-n|--service <svcname>]
         [-t|--aliasof <existing_service>]
         [-s|--source <srcimage>]
         [-b|--boot-args <boot property>=<value>,...]
         [-i|--ip-start <dhcp_ip_start>]
         [-c|--ip-count <count_of_ipaddr>]
         [-B|--bootfile-server <server_ipaddr>]
         [-d|--imagepath <imagepath>]
         [-y|--noprompt]

         This command sets up a network boot image (net image)
         in the specified imagepath directory, and creates an
         installation service that specifies how a client booted
         from the net image is installed.

         The AI boot image content is provided as an image ISO
         file, whose location is specified by with the -s option.
         The resulting net image is eventually located in
         <imagepath>.  The net image enables client
         installations.
   
         Note the following specifications:
         - When the first installation service of a given
           architecture is created on an install server, an alias
           of that service, 'default-i386' or 'default-sparc',
           is automatically created. This default service will be
           used for all client installations of that architecture
           that use the install server. To change the service
           aliased by the default-<arch> service, use the
           installadm set-service command.
         - If you want a client to use a different installation
           service than the default for that architecture, you
           must use the installadm create-client command to
           create a client-specific configuration. 
         - If the -i option and the -c option are used, 
           and a DHCP server is not yet configured, a DHCP 
           server is configured. 
         - If an already-configured DHCP server exists, 
           that DHCP server is updated.
         - If the IP range requested is not on a subnet that the
           install server has direct connectivity to and the
           install server is multihomed, the -B option is used to
           provide the address of the bootfile server (usually an
           IP address on this system). This should only be
           necessary when multiple IP addresses are configured on
           the install server and DHCP relays are employed. In
           all other configurations, the software can determine
           this automatically.

         -n|--name   <svcname>
             Optional: Uses this installation service name
             instead of a system-generated service name. 

             If -n option is not specified, a service name is
             generated automatically. 

         -t|--aliasof   <existing_service>
             Optional: Specifies that alias is to be created of
             <existing_service>, providing an alternate name for
             a service. 

         -s|--source   <srcimage>
             Optional: Specifies path to an AI ISO image, which
             is the data source for the net image.

         -b|--boot-args   <boot property>=<value>,...
             Optional: For x86 clients only, sets a property
             value in the service-specific menu.lst file in the
             service image.  Use this option to set boot
             properties that are specific to this service. This
             option can accept multiple property=value pairs.

         -i|--ip-start   <dhcp_ip_start>
             Optional: Sets up a new DHCP server. The IP
             addresses, starting from dhcp_ip_start, are set up.
             The number of IP addresses is provided by the -c
             option.

         -c|--ip-count   <dhcp_ip_cont>
             Optional: Sets up a total number of IP addresses in
             the DHCP configuration equal to the value of the 
             dhcp_ip_count.  The first IP address is the 
             value of dhcp_ip_start that is provided by the 
             -i option.  

         -B|--bootfile-server <server_ipaddr>
             Optional: Used to provide the IP address of the boot
             server from which clients should request bootfiles.
             Only required if this IP address cannot be determined
             by other means.

         -d|--imagepath   <imagepath>
             Optional: Specifies path at which to create the net
             image. If not specified, the default location, 
             /export/auto_install/<svcname>, will be used; a 
             confirmation prompt is displayed unless -y is also 
             specified.

         -y|--noprompt
             Optional: Suppresses any confirmation prompts and
             proceeds with service creation using the supplied
             options and any default values (see "-d").


    
     installadm set-service -o <prop>=<value> <svcname>
       
         Sets a property of a service to a specified value.
     
         -o|--option   <prop>=<value>
            Specifies the property and value to set.

            prop=value can be:
                 aliasof=<existing_service>
                 default-manifest=<manifest/script name>

            - aliasof=<existing_service>
              Used to modify the alias, svcname, to be an alias
              of <existing_service>.

            - default-manifest=<manifest/script name>
              The default manifest of a service may not have
              criteria actively associated with it while it is 
              the default. If one uses installadm set-service 
              to make a manifest the default, then its 
              associated criteria become "inactive", and are 
              not considered during manifest selection. 
              Inactive criteria are clearly indicated by the 
              installadm list command. If a different manifest
              is later made the default, the criteria of the
              formerly default manifest becomes active again. 

         <svcname>
              Required: Specifies the name of the installation
              service whose property is being set.


     installadm delete-service 
         [-r|--autoremove] [-y|--noprompt] <svcname>

          following:
          - Removes the installation service from the DHCP 
            configuration.
          - Deletes the manifest, profiles, client configuration
            files, and web server configuration for this
            installation service.   
          - Deletes the pkg image used to instantiate the
            service.

         -r|--autoremove <svcname>

          disables the web server associated with the service.

         <svcname>
            Required: Specifies the name of the installation
            service to be disabled.

    
     installadm list
         [-n|--service <svcname>]
         [-c|--client] [-m|--manifest] [-p|--profile]

         -n|--service <svcname>
             Optional: Lists information about the specific
             installation service on a local server. Or:
               - if the -c option is specified, lists the client 
                 information associated with the installation 
                 service. 
               - if the -m option is specified, lists the

         [-c|--criteria <criteria=value|list|range> ... | 
         -C|--criteria-file <criteria.xml>]  
         [-d|--default]

          Associates manifests with a specific install 
          service, thus making the manifests available on 
          the network, independently from creating a 
          service. When publishing a non-default manifest,
          it is required to associate criteria either via
          criteria entered on the command line (-c) or 
          via a criteria XML file (-C).

          The name of the manifest is derived from (in order):
          1) installadm add-manifest -m option, if present
          2) manifest name attribute, if present
          3) manifest filename

         -n|--service   <svcname>
              Required: Specifies the name of the install

              to add.

             services on a local server.
         -m|--manifest   <manifest_name> 
              Optional: Specifies the name of the AI manifest.
    
         -c|--criteria   <-c <criteria=value|list|range> ...> 
              Optional: Specifies criteria to be associated with
              the added non-default manifest. When publishing a
              default manifest, criteria must not be specified.
              When publishing a non-default manifest, criteria
              must be specified.

         -C|--criteria-file   <criteria.xml> 
              Optional: Specifies the path name of a criteria 
              XML file containing criteria to be associated with
              the added non-default manifest. When publishing a
              default manifest, criteria must not be specified.
              When publishing a non-default manifest, criteria
              must be specified.

         -d|--default
              Optional: Specifes that this manifest is the
              new default manifest for the service. Any criteria
              associated with the manifest are immediately 
              inactive.
    


     installadm delete-manifest
         -m|--manifest <manifest/script name> 
         -n|--service <svcname>

          Deletes a manifest that was published with a 
          specific installation service.

     -m|--manifest   <manifest_name> 
          Required: Specifies the name of an AI manifest 
          as output by installadm list with -n option.

     -n|--service   <svcname>
          Required: Specifies the name of the install 
          service this manifest is associated with.

    
     installadm create-profile -n|--service <svcname>
         -f|--file <profile_file>... 
         [-p|--profile <profile_name>]
         [-c|--criteria <criteria=value|list|range> ...] | 
         [-C|--criteria-file <criteria_file>]

         Associates profiles with a specific installation
         service. Criteria can optionally be associated with a
         profile by either entering them on the command line (-c)
         or via a criteria XML file (-C).  Profiles created
         without criteria are associated with all clients of the
         service.

         The name of the profile is derived from (in order):
         1) installadm create-profile -p option, if present
         2) profile base filename (see basename(1)).

         Profile names must be unique for an AI service.
         If multiple "-f"s are used to create more than one 
         profile with the same criteria, then the "-p" 
         option is invalid and the names of the profiles
         are derived from their filenames.

         -n|--service   <svcname>
              Required: Specifies the name of the installation
              service of the profile being updated.

         -f|--file   <profile_file> 
              Required: Specifies the path name of the file with
              which to add the profile. Multiple profiles may be 
              specified. 
    
         -p|--profile   <profile_name> 
              Optional: Specifies the name of the profile being
              created. Valid only for single profile creation.

CRITERIA

     Manifests and profiles can be used to configure AI clients
     differently according to certain characteristics, or
     criteria.  Only one manifest may be associated with a
     client, whereas any number of profiles may be associated.

     The criteria values are determined by the AI client during
     startup.

     The following AI client system criteria may be specified for
     either manifests and profiles unless otherwise noted:

     Criteria   Description
     --------   -----------
     arch     - architecture per uname(1), option '-m'
     cpu      - CPU class per uname(1), option '-p'
     hostname - assigned hostname, profiles only
     ipv4     - IP version 4 network address
     mac      - hexadecimal MAC address with ':' separators
     mem      - memory size in MiB per prtconf(1M)
     network  - IP version 4 network number
     platform - platform name per uname(1), option '-i'
     zonename - name of a zone per zones(5)

     ipv4, mac, mem, network specifications may be expressed as
     ranged values separated by a hyphen, '-'. To signify no
     limit to one end of a ranged specification, use 'unbounded'.

     Any criteria that is not specifiable as a ranged value can
     be specified as a list of values separated by white space.

     See examples below.

CRITERIA FILES

     A criteria XML file allows you to specify criteria for a
     manifest or profile by passing the file to the add-manifest, 
     create-profile, or set-criteria commands. Criteria can be
     specified as a value, a list of values, or a range, by using
     the following tags.

     For a criterion with a specific value:

     <ai_criteria_manifest>
         <ai_criteria name=XXXX>
             <value>yyyy</value>
         </ai_criteria>
     </ai_criteria_manifest>

     where XXXX is the name of the criterion (e.g. MAC, IPV4,
     MEM, or ARCH) and yyyy is the value of the criterion.

     For a criterion with a list of values:

     <ai_criteria_manifest>
         <ai_criteria name=XXXX>
             <value>
                 aaaa
                 bbbb
                 cccc
                 dddd
             </value>
         </ai_criteria>
     </ai_criteria_manifest>
     
     where XXXX is the name of the criterion (e.g. hostname,
     zonename, or any other criteria that is not a ranged
     criteria) and aaaa, bbbb, cccc, dddd are the values of
     the criterion.

     For a criterion with a range:

     <ai_criteria_manifest>
         <ai_criteria name=XXXX>
             <range>
                 yyyy1
                 yyyy2
             </range>
         </ai_criteria>
     </ai_criteria_manifest>

     where XXXX is the name of the criterion (e.g. MAC, IPV4,
     or MEM) and yyyy1 and yyyy2 are the lower and uppper 
     bounds of the range.

     Multiple criteria may be specified in the file between
     the <ai_criteria_manifest> and </ai_criteria_manifest>
     tags.
 
EXAMPLES


     Example 1: Set up an install server and an x86 installation
     service for the first time. The command includes a starting
     IP address and total count of IP addresses, in order to
     configure the DHCP server.

     # installadm create-service -n sol-11-i386-svc
       -s /export/isos/sol-11-i386.iso 
       -i 172.0.0.10 -c 10 -d /export/images/soli386


     The AI ISO image is at /export/isos/sol-11-i386.iso.
     The command sets up a net image and an installation service
     that is based on the AI ISO image,
     at /export/images/soli386.  This net image enables client
     installations.

     The DHCP server is created. The starting IP address is
     172.0.0.10 and ten IP addresses are allocated for clients.

     Because this is the first i386 service created, the
     default-i386 service, is automatically created and aliased
     to this service. The default-i386 alias is operational and
     a client booted via PXE will boot and install from the
     default-i386 service.


     Example 2: Set up a SPARC installation service for the first
     time. 

     # installadm create-service -n sol-11-sparc-svc
       -s /export/isos/sol-11-sparc.iso 
       -d /export/images/solsparc


     The AI ISO image is at /export/isos/sol-11-sparc.iso.
     The command sets up a net image and an installation service
     that is based on the AI ISO image, at
     /export/images/solsparc.  This net image enables client
     installations.

     Because this is the first SPARC service created, the
     default-sparc service, is automatically created and aliased
     to this service. The default-sparc alias is operational and
     a SPARC client will boot and install from the default-sparc
     service.


     Example 3: Use the following sample command to set 
     up a client that references a specific installation service.
     The installation service should already exist. 

     # installadm create-client -b "console=ttya"
     -e 0:e0:81:5d:bf:e0 -n my-i386-service

     In this example, the command creates a client-specific setup
     for the system with MAC address of 0:e0:81:5d:bf:e0. This
     client will use the installation service previously set up,
     named my-i386-service, and that service's associated net
     image. The command sets the boot property, console=ttya, in
     the client-specific menu.lst file in /etc/netboot.
 

     Example 4: Use the following sample command to add a new
     service named my-sparc-service, retaining existing services,
     and leaving the existing default unchanged:

     # installadm create-service -n my-sparc-service
       -s /export/isos/mysparc.iso 
       -d /export/ai/mysparc-image


     Example 5: Use the following two sample commands to add a
     new service named my-sparc-service, retaining existing
     services, and making the new service the default for 
     SPARC clients:

     # installadm create-service -n my-sparc-service
       -s /export/isos/mysparc.iso 
       -d /export/ai/mysparc-image

     # installadm set-service
       -o aliasof=my-sparc-service default-sparc


     Example 6: Use the following sample command to replace
     the default manifest for an existing installation service,
     service_092910, with a custom manifest, my_manifest.xml.
     The manifest contains a name attribute, name="default",
     which designates it as the default manifest, i.e.:
          <ai_instance name="default">
 
     # installadm add-manifest -f my_manifest.xml 
     -n service_092910


     Example 7: Use the following sample command to list the
     installation services on a local server:

         # installadm list

     In this example, the terminal displays the following output:

.sp
.in +9
.nf
Service Name     Alias Of         Status  Arch  Image Path 
------------     --------         ------  ----  ---------- 
default-i386     sol-11-i386-svc  on      x86   /export/images/soli386
default-sparc*   sol-11-sparc-svc on      Sparc /export/images/solsparc
sol-11-i386-svc  -                on      x86   /export/images/soli386
sol-11-sparc-svc -                on      Sparc /export/images/solsparc
.fi
.in -9
.sp

     Example 8: Use the following sample command to list the
     clients of a specific installation service on a local
     server:

         # installadm list -c -n my-x86-service

     In this example, the terminal displays the following output:

.sp
.in +9
.nf
Service Name   Client Address    Arch  Image Path 
------------   --------------    ----  ---------- 
my-x86-service 01:C2:52:E6:4B:E1 i386  /export/images/myimage
.fi
.in -9
.sp

     Example 9: Use the following sample command to list the 
     manifests associated with a specific installation service on
     a local server:

         # installadm list -m -n my-x86-service

     In this example, the terminal displays the following output:

.sp
.in +9
.nf
Manifest          Criteria
--------          --------
devpublisher.xml  arch     = i86pc
                  ipv4     = 010.000.002.015
                  mac      = 01:C4:51:E6:4B:E6 - 01:C4:51:E6:4B:E9
                  mem      = 2048 MB
.fi
.in -9
.sp

     Example 10: Use the following sample command to list the 
     profiles on a local server:

         # installadm list -p

     In this example, the terminal displays the following output:

.sp
.in +9
.nf
# installadm list -p
Service Name Profile
------------ -------
sparc2       myprofile.xml
             myprofile2.xml
svc0817      profile3
svc0819      profile4.xml
             newprofile
             foo.xml
.fi
.in -9
.sp


     Example 11: Use the following sample command to add the
     manifest in /export/my_manifest to svc1 with a criterion of
     MAC address equaling "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff":

         # installadm add-manifest -f /export/my_manifest -n svc1 
           -c MAC="aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" 

     In this example, the manifest does not contain a name
     attribute, so the manifest name is taken from the file name:

         # installadm list -m -n svc1

.sp
.in +9
.nf
Manifest          Criteria
--------          --------
my_manifest       mac      = AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
.fi
.in -9
.sp


     Example 12: Use the following sample command to add the 
     manifest in /export/my_manifest to svc1 with the criterion
     of IPv4 range between 10.0.2.100 to 10.0.2.199:

         # installadm add-manifest -f /export/my_manifest -n svc1 
           -m chosen_name -c IPV4="10.0.2.100-10.0.2.199" 

     In this example, the manifest name is taken from the -m
     option. 

         # installadm list -m -n svc1

.sp
.in +9
.nf
Manifest          Criteria
--------          --------
chosen_name       ipv4 = 10.0.2.100 - 10.0.2.199
.fi
.in -9
.sp

     Example 13: Use the following sample command to add the
     manifest in /export/manifest3 to svc1 with criteria of
     2048MB memory or greater and an architecture of i86pc:

         # installadm add-manifest -f /export/manifest3 -n svc1
           -c MEM="2048-unbounded" -c ARCH=i86pc
     
     In this example, the manifest name is taken from the name
     attribute of the manifest, name="my_name", i.e.:
         <ai_instance name="my_name">

         # installadm list -m -n svc1
.sp
.in +9
.nf
Manifest          Criteria
--------          --------
my_name           arch = i86pc
                  mem  = 2048 MB - unbounded
.fi
.in -9
.sp

     Example 14: Use the following sample command to add the
     profile in /export/profile4 to svc1 with criteria of
     any of the hostnames 'myhost1', 'host3', or 'host6':

         # installadm create-profile -f /export/profile4 -n svc1
           -p profile4 -c hostname="myhost1 host3 host6"

         # installadm list -p -n svc1
.sp
.in +9
.nf
Profile          Criteria
-------          --------
profile4         hostname = myhost1 host3 host6
.fi
.in -9
.sp

     Example 15: Use the following sample command to append to
     the criteria of manifest2 of svc1, a criterion of 4096MB
     memory or greater:

         # installadm set-criteria -m manifest2 -n svc1
           -a MEM="4096-unbounded"
     
     Example 16: Use the following sample command to replace the
     criteria of manifest2 of svc1 with the criteria specified by 
     the file, /tmp/criteria.xml:

         # installadm set-criteria -m manifest2 -n svc1
           -C /tmp/criteria.xml
    
     See the CRITERIA FILES section for more information on the
     contents of the criteria xml file.

     Example 17:  Use the following sample command to validate
     the profiles stored in the file myprofdir/myprofile.xml 
     and herprofdir/herprofile.xml during their development:

         # installadm validate -P myprofdir/myprofile.xml 
            -P herprofdir/herprofile.xml -n svc1

     Example 18:  Use the following sample command to export 
     the profile, myprofile.xml in service, svc1:

         # installadm export -p myprofile.xml -n svc1
