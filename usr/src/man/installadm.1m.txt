DESCRIPTION

     The automated installer (AI) is used to automate the 
     installation of the Oracle Solaris OS on one or more 
     SPARC and x86 systems over a network. The 
     installations can differ in architecture, packages 
     installed, disk capacity, and other parameters. 

     The minimal configuration necessary to use the 
     automated installer is to have one system as the 
     server and one client on which to install. On the 
     server, you set up an installation service, which 
     is associated with manifests, or specifications, 
     for specific x86 installations or SPARC installations.

     Manifests can include information such as a target 
     device, additional packages, partition information, 
     and other parameters. When the client boots, a  
     search is initiated for a manifest that matches the
     client's machine specifications. When a matching 
     manifest is found, the client is installed with the 
     Oracle Solaris release according to the specifications 
     in the manifest file.

     System configuration profiles are complementary to manifests
     in that they also contain specifications for an 
     installation. In particular, profiles are used to specify 
     configuration information such as user name, user password,
     timezone, hostname, and ip address.  System configuration
     profiles are processed by smf(5) and conform to document
     format service_bundle(4).

     Use the installadm create-service command to set up 
     an install server and create an install service. 
     
     An install service is a network entity that specifies 
     the parameters for a particular type of installation. 
     These specifications are defined in XML manifest 
     files. 
     
     The automated installer uses AI ISO images to create 
     the install services. An AI ISO image is a collection 
     of software in a single file. This image is unpacked 
     when an install service is created and used to create 
     a net image that enables client installations.

     Once an install server and an installation service are 
     set up, you can install the Oracle Solaris release to a 
     client on the network, per the default specifications 
     in the install service, by booting the client system.

     If you want to perform various types of installations 
     in a network, you can create and manage additional 
     install services tailored for each type of 
     installation by using the installadm create-service 
     command. For example, you can set up an install 
     service that installs the Oracle Solaris OS to x86 
     clients and a service that installs the Oracle Solaris
     OS to SPARC clients.

     If you have clients with varying machine specifications,
     you can manually create or modify manifests so that the
     manifests cover those specific machine specifications.
     Then, you can use the installadm add-manifest command
     to add your new manifests to an install service. You can
     also use add-manifest to specify criteria to be used in
     determining which manifest should be selected for an
     installation. You can change criteria already associated
     with a manifest with the installadm set-criteria command.

     If you want a specific client to use a specific 
     install service, you can associate a service to a 
     client by using the installadm create-client command.

     The installadm utility can be used to accomplish the 
     following tasks:
     - Set up install services
     - Set up installation images
     - Set up or remove clients
     - Add or delete manifests
     - Specify or modify criteria for a manifest
     - Add or delete system configuration profiles
     - Validate profiles
     - Add or modify criteria for a manifest or profile
     - Export profiles
     - Enable or disable install services
     - List install services
     - List manifests for an install service
     - List profiles for an install service

     
SUBCOMMANDS AND OPTIONS
     The installadm command has the subcommands and options 
     listed below. Also, see EXAMPLES below.

    
     installadm

          Displays command usage.


    
     installadm create-service [-b <property>=<value>,...]
     [-f <bootfile>] [-n <svcname>] [-i <dhcp_ip_start> 
     -c <count_of_ipaddr>] [-s <srcimage>] <targetdir>

          Creates an install service. 
    
          The command provides the following functionality:    
          - Takes an AI ISO image (<srcimage>), unpacks it, 
            and sets up a net image in a target directory
            (<targetdir>. The net image enables client 
            installations.
          - Creates an install service and makes it 
            available on the network.
   
          Note the following specifications:
          - For SPARC install services, the first install 
            service created on an install server is the 
            service that will be used for all client 
            installations that use the install server. If 
            you want a client to use a different 
            install service from this install server, you 
            must use the installadm create-client command 
            to create a client-specific configuration. 
          - By default, both a net image and an install  
            service are created. 
          - If an existing install service name is provided, 
            that existing service is used.
          - If the -s option is not used, and the 
            <targetdir> contains a valid net image, then a 
            new install service is created with the 
            existing net image.
          - If the -i option and the -c option are used, 
            and a DHCP server is not yet configured, a DHCP 
            server is configured. 
          - If an already-configured DHCP server exists, 
            that DHCP server is updated.

     -b   <property>=<value>,...
          For x86 clients only, sets a property value
          in the service-specific menu.lst file in /tftpboot.
          Use this option to set boot properties that are
          specific to this service. This option can accept
          multiple property=value pairs.

     -f   <bootfile>  
          Uses this boot file for the install service. If 
          boot file doesn't exist, it is created. If this 
          option is not specified, a boot file is created 
          with a default name.

     -n   <svcname>
          Uses this install service name instead of default 
          service name.  The service name must contain only
          alphanumeric characters, "_" and "-" and be shorter
          then 64 characters in length.

          Note: If the -n option is not used, a unique name 
          for the install service is automatically assigned
          using the format, 
          "_install_service_<number>" or 
          "_install_service_<port_number>" for older install
          images. 

          For example, if the -n option was not used to 
          provide a custom name, the previous number that 
          installadm selected for an install service is 10 
          and the install image is a newer image, then the
          install service name will be "_install_service_11".
          If the -n option was not used, the install image
          is an older image, and the port number that installadm
          selected for an install service is 46510, then the
          install service name will be "_install_service_46510." 

     -i   <dhcp_ip_start>
          Sets up a new DHCP server. The IP addresses, 
          starting from dhcp_address_start, are set up.

     -c   <count_of_ipaddr>
          Sets up a total number of IP addresses in the 
          DHCP table equal to the value of the 
          count_of_ipaddr. The first IP address is the 
          value of dhcp_ip_start that is provided by the 
          -i option.  

     -s   <srcimage>
          Specifies location of AI ISO image to use for 
          setting up the install service.

     <targetdir>   
            
           Required: Specifies location to set up net image.


    
     installadm delete-service [-x] <svcname>

           Deletes an install service. Accomplishes the 
           following:
           - Removes install service from the network.
           - Stops the web server that is running for this 
             install service. 
           - Removes the manifest files and web server 
             configuration for this install service.   
         
     -x    Deletes the install service and also removes the 
           associated target net image.  

     <svcname>
     
           Required: Specifies the install service name.


    
     installadm list [-n <svcname>] [-c] [-m] [-p]

         Lists all enabled install services on a server.

         -c
             Lists the clients of the install services on a local
             server.

         -m
             Lists the manifests associated with the install ser-
             vices on a local server.

         -n <svcname>
             Lists information about the specific install service
             on a local server. Or:
               - if the -c option is specified, lists the client 
                 information associated with the install service. 
               - if the -m option is specified, lists the 
                 manifests associated with the install service. 
               - if the -p option is specified, lists the 
                 profiles associated with the install service.

         -p 
             Lists the profiles associated with the install ser-
             vices on a local server.


     installadm enable <svcname>

          Enables a specified install service. Also,
          enables the web server associated with the
          service.

     <svcname>

           Required: Specifies the name of the install
           service to be enabled.



     installadm disable <svcname>

          Disables a specified install service. Also, 
          disables the web server associated with the 
          service.

          Required: Specifies the name of the install 
          service to be disabled.



     installadm add-manifest -n <svcname>
     -f <manifest_file>  [-m <manifest_name>]
     [-c <criteria=value|list|range> ... | -C <criteria.xml>]

          Associates manifests with a specific install 
          service, thus making the manifests available on 
          the network, independently from creating a 
          service. When publishing a non-default manifest,
          it is required to associate criteria either via
          criteria entered on the command line (-c) or 
          via a criteria XML file (-C).

          The name of the manifest is derived from (in order):
          1) installadm add-manifest -m option, if present
          2) manifest name attribute, if present
          3) manifest filename

     -f   <manifest_file> 
          Required: Specifies the path name of the manifest
          to add.

     -n   <svcname>
          Required: Specifies the name of the install 
          service this manifest is to be associated with.

     -m   <manifest_name> 
          Optional: Specifies the name of the AI manifest.
    
     -c   <-c <criteria=value|list|range> ...> 
          Optional: Specifies criteria to be associated with the
          added non-default manifest. When publishing a default
          manifest, criteria must not be specified. When 
          publishing a non-default manifest, criteria must be
          specified.

     -C   <criteria.xml> 
          Optional: Specifies the path name of a criteria 
          XML file containing criteria to be associated with the
          added non-default manifest. When publishing a default
          manifest, criteria must not be specified. When 
          publishing a non-default manifest, criteria must be 
          specified.


     installadm delete-manifest -m <manifest_name> -n <svcname>

          Deletes a manifest that was published with a 
          specific install service.

     -m   <manifest_name> 
          Required: Specifies the name of an AI manifest 
          as output by installadm list with -n option.

     -n   <svcname>

          service this manifest is associated with.

    
     installadm create-profile -n <svcname>  
           -f <profile_file> ... -p <profile_name>
          [-c <criteria=value|list|range> ... | -C <criteria.xml>]

         Associates profiles with a specific install service. 
         Criteria can optionally be associated with a profile by 
         either entering them on the command line (-c) or via a 
         criteria XML file (-C).  Profiles created without 
         criteria are associated with all clients of the 
         service.

         The name of the profile is derived from (in order):
         1) installadm create-profile -p option, if present
         2) profile base filename (see basename(1)).

         Profile names must be unique for an AI service.
         If multiple "-f"s are used to create more than one 
         profile with the same criteria, then the "-p" 
         option is invalid and the names of the profiles
         are derived from their filenames.

         -c   <criteria=value|list|range> ... 
              Specifies criteria to be associated with the
              profile(s).

              containing criteria to be associated with the
              specified profile(s). 

         -f   <profile> 
              Specifies the path name of the file with which to 
              add the profile. Multiple profiles may be 
              specified. 
    
         -n   <svcname>
              Specifies the name of the install service of the 
              profile being updated.

         -p   <profile_name> 
              Specifies the name of the profile being created. 
              Valid only for single profile creation.


     installadm delete-profile -n <svcname> -p <profile_name> ...

         Deletes a profile that is associated with a specific 
         install service.
    
         -n   <svcname>
              Specifies the name of the install service of the 
              profile being deleted.

         -p   <profile_name> 
              Specifies the name of the profile to delete.


     installadm set-criteria  -n <svcname> 
         [-m <manifest_name>] [-p <profile_name> ...]

         { -C <criteria.xml> }

         Updates criteria of an already published manifest,
         profile, or both. Criteria can be specified via the 
         command line or or via a criteria xml file. Criteria
         must be specified with one of the mutually exclusive
         options, -a, -c, or -C.

         Valid criteria are described under the add-manifest
         subcommand.

         -a   <criteria=value|list|range> 
              Specifies criteria to be appended to the existing 
              criteria for the manifest or profile. If the
              criteria specified already exists, the
              value/list/range of that criteria is replaced by
              the specified value/list/range.

         -c   <criteria=value|list|range>  
              Specifies criteria to replace all existing

CRITERIA

     Manifests and profiles can be used to configure AI clients
     differently according to certain characteristics, or
     criteria.  Only one manifest may be associated with a
     client, whereas any number of profiles may be associated.

     The criteria values are determined by the AI client during
     startup.

     The following AI client system criteria may be specified for
     either manifests and profiles unless otherwise noted:

     Criteria   Description
     --------   -----------
     arch     - architecture per uname(1), option '-m'
     cpu      - CPU class per uname(1), option '-p'
     hostname - assigned hostname, profiles only
     ipv4     - IP version 4 network address
     mac      - hexadecimal MAC address with ':' separators
     mem      - memory size in MiB per prtconf(1M)
     network  - IP version 4 network number
     platform - platform name per uname(1), option '-i'
     zonename - name of a zone per zones(5)

     ipv4, mac, mem, network specifications may be expressed as
     ranged values separated by a hyphen, '-'. To signify no
     limit to one end of a ranged specification, use 'unbounded'.

     Any criteria that is not specifiable as a ranged value can
     be specified as a list of values separated by white space.

     See examples below.

CRITERIA FILES

     A criteria XML file allows you to specify criteria for a
     manifest or profile by passing the file to the add-manifest, 
     create-profile, or set-criteria commands. Criteria can be
     specified as a value, a list of values, or a range, by using
     the following tags.

     For a criterion with a specific value:

     <ai_criteria_manifest>
         <ai_criteria name=XXXX>
             <value>yyyy</value>
         </ai_criteria>
     </ai_criteria_manifest>

     where XXXX is the name of the criterion (e.g. MAC, IPV4,
     MEM, or ARCH) and yyyy is the value of the criterion.

     For a criterion with a list of values:

     <ai_criteria_manifest>
         <ai_criteria name=XXXX>
             <value>
                 aaaa
                 bbbb
                 cccc
                 dddd
             </value>
         </ai_criteria>
     </ai_criteria_manifest>
     
     where XXXX is the name of the criterion (e.g. hostname,
     zonename, or any other criteria that is not a ranged
     criteria) and aaaa, bbbb, cccc, dddd are the values of
     the criterion.

     For a criterion with a range:

     <ai_criteria_manifest>
         <ai_criteria name=XXXX>
             <range>
                 yyyy1
                 yyyy2
             </range>
         </ai_criteria>
     </ai_criteria_manifest>

     where XXXX is the name of the criterion (e.g. MAC, IPV4,
     or MEM) and yyyy1 and yyyy2 are the lower and uppper 
     bounds of the range.

     Multiple criteria may be specified in the file between
     the <ai_criteria_manifest> and </ai_criteria_manifest>
     tags.
 
EXAMPLES


     Example 1: Set up an install server and an install 
     service for the first time. The command includes a 
     starting IP address and total count of IP addresses, 
     in order to configure the DHCP server.

     Example% # installadm create-service -n 0906x86 \ 
     -i 10.6.68.201 -c 5 -s \
     /export/aiimages/osol-0906-ai-x86.iso \
     /export/aiserver/osol-0906-ai-x86


     In this example, the terminal displays the progress 
     as follows:

     Setting up the target image at 
     /export/aiserver/osol-0906-ai-x86 ...
     Registering the service 0906x86._OSInstall._tcp.local
     Creating DHCP Server
     Created DHCP configuration file.
     Created dhcptab.
     Added "Locale" macro to dhcptab.
     Added server macro to dhcptab - line1-x4100.
     DHCP server started.
     Added network macro to dhcptab - 10.0.0.0.
     Created network table.
     copying boot file to 
     /tftpboot/pxegrub.I86PC.Solaris-1
     Service discovery fallback mechanism set up

     The AI ISO image is at 
     /export/aiimages/osol-0906-ai-x86.iso. The command 
     sets up a net image and an install service that is 
     based on the AI ISO image.

     The installation net image is created in the 
     /export/aiserver/osol-0906-ai-x86 target directory. 
     This net image enables client installations.

     The progress display shows that the install service, 
     named 0906x86, is created. 

     A boot file is created, also named 0906x86, 
     under /tftpboot. The client will get this file name 
     through DHCP. The command also creates a link from 
     the net image at /export/aiserver/osol-0906-ai-x86 
     to a web server that is running on port 5555.
    
     The DHCP server and macro is created. The starting 
     IP address is 0.6.68.201. Five IP addresses are 
     allocated for clients. The command results 
     identify the macro as dhcp_macro_0906x86.



     Example 2: Use the following sample command to set 
     up a client that references a specific install service 
     and a specific net image location.

     The install service and net image should already exist. 

     # installadm create-client -b "console=ttya" \
     -e 0:e0:81:5d:bf:e0 -t \
     /export/aiserver/osol-0906-ai-x86 -n 0906x86

     In this example, the terminal displays the 
     following output:

     ---
     Setting up X86 client...
     Service discovery fallback mechanism set up

     Detected that DHCP is not set up on this server.
     If not already configured, please create a DHCP macro
     named 0100E0815DBFE0 with:
     Boot server IP (BootSrvA) : 10.6.68.29
     Boot file      (BootFile) : 0100E0815DBFE0
     If you are running the Solaris DHCP Server, use the 
     following command to add the DHCP macro, 
     0100E0815DBFE0:
     /usr/sbin/dhtadm -g -A -m 0100E0815DBFE0 -d \    
     :BootSrvA=10.6.68.29:BootFile=0100E0815DBFE0:\
     GrubMenu=menu.lst.0100E0815DBFE0:

     Note: Be sure to assign client IP address(es) if needed
     (e.g., if running the Solaris DHCP Server, run pntadm(1M)).
     ----

     In this example, the command creates a 
     client-specific setup for the system with MAC address 
     of 0:e0:81:5d:bf:e0. 
     
     This client will use the install service previously 
     set up, named 0906x86, and the net image at 
     /export/aiserver/osol-0906-ai-x86.

     Using the -b option, the command sets the console 
     value, <console=ttya>, in the client-specific 
     menu.lst file in /tftpboot.
 
     As shown above, this command outputs the name of 
     the client-specific macro, 0100E0815DBFE0,
     and its values that need to be added to the DHCP 
     server. If you have a Sun DHCP server, create the 
     above macro on your DHCP server by running the dhtadm 
     command from the output on your DHCP server.

     The pntadm(1M) command may need to be called if you 
     set up a Sun DHCP server and client IP addresses 
     need to be assigned.  See the pntadm(1M) manpage for 
     more information.

     On systems which support graphic interfaces, the 
     DHCP Manager may be used instead of the dhtadm or 
     pntadm commands. See the dhcpmgr(1M) manpage for more 
     information.

     
     Example 3: Use the following sample command to replace
     the default manifest for an existing install service,
     service_092910, with a custom manifest, my_manifest.xml.
     The manifest contains a name attribute, name="default",
     which designates it as the default manifest, i.e.:
          <ai_instance name="default">
 
     # installadm add-manifest -f my_manifest.xml 
     -n service_092910


     Example 4: Use the following  sample  command  to  list  the
     install services on a local server:

         # installadm list

     In this example, the terminal displays the following output:

.sp
.in +9
.nf
Service Name Status       Arch  Port  Image Path
------------ ------       ----  ----  ----------
svc-2008-11  off          x86   45602 /export/server/osol-0811-ai-x86
svc-2009-06  on           x86   45601 /export/server/osol-0906-ai-x86
svc-bld-127  on           x86   45603 /export/server/osol-b127-ai-x86
.fi
.in -9
.sp

     Example 5: Use the following  sample  command  to  list  the
     clients for a specific install service of a local server:

         # installadm list -c -n svc-2009-06

     In this example, the terminal displays the following output:

.sp
.in +9
.nf
Service Name Client Address    Arch  Image Path
------------ --------------    ----  ----------
svc-2009-06  01:C2:52:E6:4B:E1 x86   /export/server/osol-0906-ai-x86
.fi
.in -9
.sp

     Example 6: Use the following sample command to list the man-
     ifests associated with a specific install service on a local
     server:

         # installadm list -m -n svc-2009-06

     In this example, the terminal displays the following output:

.sp
.in +9
.nf
Manifest          Criteria
--------          --------
devpublisher.xml  arch     = i86pc
                  ipv4     = 010.000.002.015
                  mac      = 01:C4:51:E6:4B:E6 - 01:C4:51:E6:4B:E9
                  mem      = 2048 MB
.fi
.in -9
.sp

     Example 7: Use the following sample command to list the 
     profiles on a local server:

         # installadm list -p

     In this example, the terminal displays the following output:

.sp
.in +9
.nf
# installadm list -p
Service Name Profile
------------ -------
sparc2       myprofile.xml
             myprofile2.xml
svc0817      profile3
svc0819      profile4.xml
             newprofile
             foo.xml
.fi
.in -9
.sp

     Example 8: Use the following sample command to add the
     manifest in /export/my_manifest to svc1 with a criterion of
     MAC address equaling "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff":

         # installadm add-manifest -f /export/my_manifest -n svc1 
           -c MAC="aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" 

     In this example, the manifest does not contain a name
     attribute, so the manifest name is taken from the file name:

         # installadm list -m -n svc1

.sp
.in +9
.nf
Manifest          Criteria
--------          --------
my_manifest       mac      = AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
.fi
.in -9
.sp


     Example 9: Use the following sample command to add the 
     manifest in /export/my_manifest to svc1 with the criterion
     of IPv4 range between 10.0.2.100 to 10.0.2.199:

         # installadm add-manifest -f /export/my_manifest -n svc1 
           -m chosen_name -c IPV4="10.0.2.100-10.0.2.199" 

     In this example, the manifest name is taken from the -m
     option. 

         # installadm list -m -n svc1

.sp
.in +9
.nf
Manifest          Criteria
--------          --------
chosen_name       ipv4 = 10.0.2.100 - 10.0.2.199
.fi
.in -9
.sp

     Example 10: Use the following sample command to add the
     manifest in /export/manifest3 to svc1 with criteria of
     2048MB memory or greater and an architecture of i86pc:

         # installadm add-manifest -f /export/manifest3 -n svc1
           -c MEM="2048-unbounded" -c ARCH=i86pc
     
     In this example, the manifest name is taken from the name
     attribute of the manifest, name="my_name", i.e.:
         <ai_instance name="my_name">

         # installadm list -m -n svc1
.sp
.in +9
.nf
Manifest          Criteria
--------          --------
my_name           arch = i86pc
                  mem  = 2048 MB - unbounded
.fi
.in -9
.sp

     Example 11: Use the following sample command to add the
     profile in /export/profile4 to svc1 with criteria of
     any of the hostnames 'myhost1', 'host3', or 'host6':

         # installadm create-profile -f /export/profile4 -n svc1
           -p profile4 -c hostname="myhost1 host3 host6"

         # installadm list -p -n svc1
.sp
.in +9
.nf
Profile          Criteria
-------          --------
profile4         hostname = myhost1 host3 host6
.fi
.in -9
.sp

     Example 12: Use the following sample command to append to
     the criteria of manifest2 of svc1, a criterion of 4096MB
     memory or greater:

         # installadm set-criteria -m manifest2 -n svc1
           -a MEM="4096-unbounded"
     
     Example 13: Use the following sample command to replace the
     criteria of manifest2 of svc1 with the criteria specified by 
     the file, /tmp/criteria.xml:

         # installadm set-criteria -m manifest2 -n svc1
           -C /tmp/criteria.xml
    
     See the CRITERIA FILES section for more information on the
     contents of the criteria xml file.

     Example 14:  Use the following sample command to validate
     the profiles stored in the file myprofdir/myprofile.xml 
     and herprofdir/herprofile.xml during their development:

         # installadm validate -P myprofdir/myprofile.xml \
            -P herprofdir/herprofile.xml -n svc1

     Example 15:  Use the following sample command to export 
     the profile, myprofile.xml in service, svc1:

         # installadm export -p myprofile.xml -n svc1
