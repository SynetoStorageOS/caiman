'''
To run these tests, see the instructions in usr/src/tools/tests/README.
Remember that since the proto area is used for the PYTHONPATH, the gate
must be rebuilt for these tests to pick up any changes in the tested code.
Note: the XML files are picked up from usr/src/cmd/auto-install and not the
proto area.
Note: the DTD files are picked up from usr/src/install_manifest/dtd and not
the proto area.
