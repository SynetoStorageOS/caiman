Boot menu modifications to be applied to the image (DC) or on the installed
system (AI) on X86.

NOTE: On SPARC, only the "title" element is supported and only then when using
      the Automated Installer (AI), "title" will be applied to boot menu file,
      '/boot/menu.lst'

Optional attributes that can be specified here are:

title   - title for the specialized boot entry
          Default is to use the first line of /etc/release

timeout
        - boot loader timeout value before the default boot entry
          is automatically activated. Ignored on OBP boot based
          SPARC systems

Boot entries to add to the default boot menu in the image (DC) or
on the installed system (AI) on X86 systems. 

NOTE: This XML section is *not* supported on OBP boot based SPARC
      systems and will be ignored.

default_entry - If the boot_entry has this attribute set to "true" then it
                will be the default boot entry activated by the boot loader.
                Note that if more than one boot entry has this attribute set
                to "true", the last entry defined as such will override
                preceeding default boot_entry elements set to "true".

insert_at     - Optional attribute indicating the desired insertion point
                relative to the existing list of boot entries. Valid values
                are "start" or "end" only. If omitted the default action
                is to append the entry to the end of the list.
